# Critique by Design

## Step one: Select a data visualization 

For this exercise, I wanted to work with a visualization that considered student loan debt and repayment options, which is a policy research topic I recently engaged with in another Heinz course.  In my research on the topic I learned about income-driven repayment (IDR) plans. An income-driven repayment plan sets a borrower's monthly student loan payment at an amount that is intended to be affordable based on your income and family size. There are multiple IDR options available to borrowers, which offer set timelines for repayment using fixed amounts— most often 10% income. Borrowers pay that percentage of earnings monthly until the timeline is up, when the remining balance is forgiven. 

I selected this visual from "Trends in College Pricing and Student Aid 2020" authored by research scientists at College Board. As a reader, I found the visual was difficult to read and had the potential to make a stronger point about IDR, which was highlighted in the subtitle but not the data visualization.

This visualization shows how outstanding student loan debt has been shared across repayment plan selection at three points in recent history- 2017, 2017, and 2020.  Overall, this data visualization has included two different, but complimentary, sets of information by representing the repayment plan variable using percent of dollars and percent of borrowers. While these can use the same scale, it does not help with perceptibility to have the different data alternating on the x-axis. At that, it is not clear that the visualization is supporting the educational goal of this section of the report, which is subtitled, “more than half of the debt owed by student loan borrowers in repayment is now in Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans that limit monthly payments to a share of income.”

## Step two: Critique the visualization

## Step three: Wireframe a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

## Step five: Build your solution
