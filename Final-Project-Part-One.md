# Final Project Part One
## Fatal Encounters: Addressing the disparities and violence in US traffic stops  

## Outline

Traffic stops are the most common way that police interact with the public in the United States. Recent reporting by the New York Times found that throughout the United States, police consider traffic stops to be among the most dangerous things they do. Yet, an investigation of traffic stop data reveals that this perception of risk is significantly overstated. While not statistically supported, the belief has an impact on police department and courtroom culture and standards, which not only creates a risk to the public but continues a standard allowing impunity for the majority of police officers who use lethal force at vehicle stops.

### Part 1 : Setup 
- Introduce traffic stops 
   - What is the goal of traffic stops?
   - What is funded by traffic stops? 
- Introduce police-public Interactions
   - Unequal Demographics by race/gender
- High- level Problem with police violence 
   - Show map 
   - Proportion of police violence that is related to traffic stops 

### Part 2: Conflict 
- How often is deadly force at a traffic stop because of danger to the police?
-- Statistics show police are often not in danger
-- Statistics show police create a more dangerous situation by not following procedures 
-- Statistics show impact on communities are unequal 
- Where is this happening and how are police trained? 
-- Statistics from the police scorecard dataset 
- Who is accountable when police take lives? 
-- Frequency of convictions vs. settlement payouts 

### Part 3: Resolution 
- What do police say? 
-- Police survey data 
- What do experts recommend? 
-- Message: Civilian deaths and costs to community could be avoided if police officers do not put themselves in danger/have better training. 

### Part 4: Call to Action 
- Ongoing efforts to use open data/political participation to call for change at local/state/federal level
-- Link to an low-level petition for officer training 
-- Provide higher-level action about separating traffic stops from municipal funding

## Data
The following data sources have been collected and aggregated by the The Washington Post, and the research groups Mapping Police Violence. A blog post from the RAND corporation validated and referenced the Police1 survey. 

1. [Police Scorecard](scorecard.csv) by the Police Scorecard Project 
2. [Fatal Police Shootings](fatal-police-shootings-data.csv) by the Washington Post 
3. [Contacts Between Police and the Public](DOJ_police_contacts.pdf) by the DOJ Bureau of Justice Statistics
4. [Police Perceptions Survey](Police1_Survey.pdf) by Police1 
 
"The Police Scorecard is the first nationwide public evaluation of policing in the United States. The Scorecard calculates levels of police violence, accountability, racial bias and other policing outcomes for over 16,000 municipal and county law enforcement agencies, covering nearly 100% of the US population."
