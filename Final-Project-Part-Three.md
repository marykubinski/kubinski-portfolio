# Final Project Part Three 

## Project Summary

I was inspired to create this project after listening to the New York Times podcast, "Why do so many traffic stops go wrong?." The podcast was gripping and emotion- with key statistics and mentions of data throughout. The podcast, an audio form of storytelling, was full of powerful sound clips from recordings of police-public interacions and interviews. With some academic background in policing, I wanted to dive into the data surrounding the violence and unsafe practices of US police. My goal was to use the investigative journalism from the New York Times as a starting point and to tell a location-specific story that considered changes being made across the country and narrowed down to define what actions could be taken to make traffic enforcement (and driving) safer in Pittsburgh. 

Key points that my story aimed to establish were:  
1. Traffic stops are one of the most common forms of police-public interaction, so we can all be concerned about this issue. 
2. Traffic enforcement, especially low-level/secondary/pretextual stops, are more common and more dangerous for some communities due to the disproportionate impact on Black drivers and other drivers of color. 
3. Survey data from police demonstrates an awareness from the sample of respondents that training frequency and content is inadequate. 
4. Across the country, cities and states are currently making legislative changes to reduce the negative impacts of low-level/secondary/pretextual stops. Responsibilities can be shifted to Transportation Departments or even cameras.  
5. Representatives and community groups are fighting for these changes to happen in Pittsburgh, now! It provides the classroom (and broader) audience an opportunity to get engaged in local policy-making. 

### Changes since Part 2

Changes following the Part 2 were motivated by assignment feedback, feedback from a friend, and additional clarity on what message I hoped to convey to an audience. A major change is the additional focus on low-level/secondary/pretextual stops. Highlighting low-level arrest rates and the emotional and community impacts of pretextual policing was motivated by learning that the Pittsburgh City Council is actively reviewing legislation on the topic. 

#### Chart Changes 

A common source of changes was chart titles. I received TA feedback to make sure to add a title that tells an idea, not just summarize the content or structure of a chart. This feedback helped me to change the charts now titled, "Traffic Stops Consistently Leads Police-Public Contact," "People of Color Experience Higher Rates of Threats or Use of Force at Traffic Stops," and "Most Officers Report Little to No Traffic Stop Training." 

Based on feedback and reflection, I removed a scatterplot visual of police-force size and low-level arrests per 10k population, as there was no meaningful trend in the data. Instead, I included the stacked area chart because it demonstrated that big cities are transitioning to policies that support less arrests for low-level crime. I decided to include this chart to support my narritive for reducing the policing of low level or secondary offenses that do not impact public safety. Similarly, I changed the "Traffic Stops Consistently Leads Police-Public Contact" chart from a line chart to a donut chart. This chart aims to show proportions more so than change over time, so this chart seemed to be a more appropriate format, given user feedback. 

I also made a number of color changes to charts, while keeping the same colors overall. I removed the red from "People of Color Experience Higher Rates of Threats or Use of Force at Traffic Stops" because throughout the presentation, red acted as my highlight color. In this chart, I was not aiming to draw audience attention to any particular variable. Throughout, I more consistently used gray to de-emphasize alongside red. If I felt two variables were of equal importance, I used the red and blue as contrasting colors. 

I also included three pictograms in the story, based on the feedback to create visuals to accompany key statistics. 

#### Narrative Changes 

Narrative changes included adding additional context to how each chart related to the story. In Part 2, I had a number of weak transitions between components of the story or unexplained assumptions. For example, I added a more explicit explanation of why the "Common Interactions" subsection mattered to the narrative as well as why the "Trends in Training" could be relevant to ending low level traffic stops. A similar change to address my own assumptions was to explain what the map using Police Scorecard data was showing, how it was related to the story, and what the slider function of the map could be used for, as suggested in my TA assessment feedback. This was another instance of author assumptions about how the website would be read as well as oversight on what data the user would understand. Based on my existing knowledge of criminal justice and policing policy, I did not think to include explicit mentions of the police scorecard in the narrative of the story. 

As mentioned earlier, research on legislation in Pittsburgh City Council informed some narrative emphasis and the layout of my call to action. In Part 2, my users suggested creating more "active" actions. However, action on a local policy issue is often challenging if the audience member does not feel fully educated on a topic, especially one that is sensitive, triggering, or politically-charged. As such, I wanted to continue to provide resources for further learning. The "Why/Learn More/Take Action" format felt like a playbook that I would follow as a concerned community member looking to get involved or as a policy-maker new to a topic. With hopes of making this national to local transition less shocking, I included an earlier example from Pittsburgh in the section on Discriminatory Practices. I also included a few paragraphs on Pittsburgh policing- including some data and current policy events- in the Call to Action section to ground the reader's transition. 

The decision to focus on Pittsburgh for the conclusion and call to action was not only because the classroom presentation will be in Pittsburgh, but becuase of the local level at which policy change and decision-making around policing occurs. 

### Intended Audience 

When writing about police reform, it is possible to discourage readers who feel loyalty to the police or other public safety institutions. While my presentation has an obvious political leaning, I hoped to not discourage potential audience members like my older, conservative family member. This goal informed my decision to feature the Police1 Survey data in multiple sections of the presentation. It also informed my decision to have three levels within the call to action. The first level calls for changing training, but not police officer responsibility. While the second calls for limiting responsiblity and the third is a total shift in traffic enforcement away from the police. As such, I hope that a politically diverse audience could all relate to a next-step.
