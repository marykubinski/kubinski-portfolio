## User Research & Interviews

Goals of the  user research protocol should clearly identify the following:

a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story; b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview; c. your interview script; d. the findings from your interviews; and e. changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified.

### Target Audience 

The audience I hope to reach includes any residents of the US who have been drivers or passengers of private vehicle. Traffic stops impact a wide section of people and I will plan to reach individuals of different ages, geographic locations, and political beliefs. The goal of my project is to educate the target audience on the current policing training and practices that surround traffic stops. The call to action is segmented into three levels- each level that has a more dramatic pogram or policy response. If given a longer research timeframe, I would be interested in identifying individuals who live in highly-policed communities as well as individuals who work in law enforcement. 

### Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview

With hopes of reaching out to this target audience, I contacted individuals who are licensed to drive in the United States. I tried to recruit individuals with differing ages and political beliefs. I reached out to family and friends fit these criteria. The information that I wanted to collect on my interview subjects were the following:

### Interview Script 

My goal is to collect feedback on my Telling Stories with Data project, which was motivated by a New York Times podcast about traffic stops. My goal will be to get your input on the flow of the narrative, the design and data visualizations, and if the call to action logically follows the path of the story. 

#### Narrative Flow 

1. Does the story progress in a logical way? Would you reorder any of the sections? 
2. Are there any questions that you still have at the end?

#### Design and Data Visualization 

1. Are the data visualizations clear? If not, what would you change? 
2. Is there anything you find surprising or confusing (about the layout of the charts)?
3. What do you think about the use of color and images? Are they helpful or distracting? 

#### Calls to Action 

1. Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
2. Do the calls to action flow logically from the story? What could be added or changed to inspire action? 
3. What other suggestions or feedback to you have? 

### Interview Findings 

The findings of my interview are summarized in the table below:
