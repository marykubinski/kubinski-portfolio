## User Research & Interviews

Goals of the  user research protocol should clearly identify the following:

a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story; b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview; c. your interview script; d. the findings from your interviews; and e. changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified.

### Target Audience 

The audience I hope to reach includes any residents of the US who have been drivers or passengers of private vehicle. Traffic stops impact a wide section of people and I will plan to reach individuals of different ages, geographic locations, and political beliefs. The goal of my project is to educate the target audience on the current policing training and practices that surround traffic stops. The call to action is segmented into three levels- each level that has a more dramatic pogram or policy response. If given a longer research timeframe, I would be interested in identifying individuals who live in highly-policed communities as well as individuals who work in law enforcement. 

### Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview

With hopes of reaching out to this target audience, I contacted individuals who are licensed to drive in the United States. I tried to recruit individuals with differing ages and political beliefs. I reached out to family and friends fit these criteria. The information that I wanted to collect on my interview subjects were the following:

### Interview Script 

My goal is to collect feedback on my Telling Stories with Data project, which was motivated by a New York Times podcast about traffic stops. My goal will be to get your input on the flow of the narrative, the design and data visualizations, and if the call to action logically follows the path of the story. 

#### Narrative Flow 

1. Does the story progress in a logical way? Would you reorder any of the sections? 
2. Are there any questions that you still have at the end?

#### Design and Data Visualization 

1. Are the data visualizations clear? If not, what would you change? 
2. Is there anything you find surprising or confusing (about the layout of the charts)?
3. What do you think about the use of color and images? Are they helpful or distracting? 

#### Calls to Action 

1. Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
2. Do the calls to action flow logically from the story? What could be added or changed to inspire action? 
3. What other suggestions or feedback to you have? 

### Interview Findings 

The findings of my interview are summarized in the table below: 

Narrative Flow 

1. Does the story progress in a logical way? Would you reorder any of the sections? 
Jen: Would not re-order anything. 
3. Are there any questions that you still have at the end or information you feel is missing?
Jen: I don't think so. But, I'm just back at the beginning becuase looking at the bar graph looking at traffic stops resulting in noncompliance. I didn't get the title. I didn't get what noncompliance meant. If I didn't have you walking me through it, I would still be confunsed. So I had that question earlier.  

Design and Data Visualization 

1. Are the data visualizations clear? If not, what would you change? 
Jen: In terms of what I would change- I think the title can help. This is saying "what do the police perceive are most likely to result in non-compliant or is this what happens." So, I would try to find away to make the title more clear that this is what police are saying. What they think is non-compliance. Could you just explain what the dataset is? You could change the title? Or add an X-title. I do think I like this survey part of the data because I think it's good to point out the pretextual stops. Since you are talking in the beginning about police preceptions and things that are happening, because this is what police define as non-compliance. It's all related to their concpetion- so keep it here. The tableau map is cool. 
2. Is there anything you find surprising or confusing (about the layout of the charts)?
Jen:That title. 
3. What do you think about the use of color and images? Are they helpful or distracting? 
Jen: On the line chart- the lines being slightly different makes me think I should look at them. I understand that because we are talking about traffic stops- but I didn't find this intuitive in the beginning. I like the color skeme in general. You avoiding problems for red-green colorblindness. The images are good- they are not distracting and are relevant to the sections and work to break up the text. 

Calls to Action 

1. Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Jen: This is probably a general audience- I could see it being intended as a news audience. It's pretty accessible. I don't think it assumes a level of knowedge or educaiton- maybe general consumers of news. 
2. Do the calls to action flow logically from the story? Are the "active" enough calls to action? 
Jen: I think they flow and that they pull out something that you already talked about. You talked about training and pretextual stops and those experiences- so that is founded in something you talked about. I do see that it's a more call to action for policy makers or police agencies themselves. So, I could see a reader wanting a more direction action/petition/write to your legislature. That may fit the audience better. 
3. What other suggestions or feedback do you have? 
Jen: I like this a lot. One thing that I think about a lot when I think about police things is language- so I wondered about "unnecessary violence" I am someone who thinks all violence is unnecessary. I am also hyperaware of language.
