This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data (course 94-870 at CMU) 

# About me
Hi all! I'm Mary Kubinski! (she/her/hers)

I am a second year Masters Candidate at the Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University. I am pursuing an MS in Public Policy and Management. My coursework has included policy analysis and methods, like Statistics with R, Programming R for Analytics, GIS, and Policy Analysis in Practice, and management, like, Management Science I & II, and Project Management. 

Some projects I have worked on at Heinz include: CMS Hospital Price Transparency Rule Implementation Analysis, Policy Innovation Lab: Police Data Initiative, and Growth & Intelligent Transportation Systems:Transit Signal Priorities. Outside of Heinz, I have supported research and projects in international trade, regional industrial economic development, and smart cities technology. Data visualizations have been a part of all this work! 

Before graduate school, I was an education sector Peace Corps Volunteer in Thailand. I completed a BA in Political Science and Public Policy studies at HWS Colleges in the Finger Lakes region of New York State. In the Finger Lakes, I also learned a lot about community organizing, people-centered policy, and wine! 

# What I hope to learn
At Carnegie Mellon University, my coursework has developed my confidence working with data, but through this course I hope to gain new skills and understanding of how to share that data. I find myself drawn to visuals shared on Twitter and email news briefs- then thinking, "wonderful- how can I make that!?" or "that could be better." In this course I hope to not only gain a greater knowledge of what makes a visual work (or not), but also how to talk about it and offer suggestions. I am nervous, but eager, to put hands on keyboard (and paper) to practice critiquing and creating. 

I also hope to deeply engage and conduct user research, to collect new insights and product feedback that I can use to iterate better versions of my visualizations and stories. This will be a new experience collecting feedback on work that I will create and re-create alone, instead of in a group. I hope that this process will help me open up to new perspectives and create products that appeal to wide audiences.
