This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data (course 94-870 at CMU) 

# About me
Hi all! I'm Mary Kubinski! (she/her/hers)

I am a second year MS Candidate at the Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University, studying Public Policy and Management. My coursework has covered policy analysis tools and methods (like Statistics with R, Programming R for Analytics, GIS, and Policy Analysis in Practice) and management (like Management Science I & II, Negotiation, and Project Management). 

Some projects I have worked on at Heinz that included collecting and displaying data include: 
* CMS Hospital Price Transparency Rule Implementation Analysis
* Policy Innovation Lab: Police Data Initiative
* Growth & Intelligent Transportation Systems: Transit Signal Priorities
Outside of Heinz, I have supported research and projects in international trade, regional industrial economic development, and smart cities technology. Data visualizations have also been a small part of all this work! 

Before graduate school, I was an education sector Peace Corps Volunteer in Thailand. I completed a BA in Political Science and Public Policy studies at HWS Colleges in the Finger Lakes region of New York State. In the Finger Lakes, I also learned about community organizing, people-centered policy, and wine! 

# What I hope to learn
At Carnegie Mellon University, my coursework has developed my confidence working with data, but through this course I hope to gain new skills of how to share that data. I find myself drawn to visuals shared on Twitter and email news briefs- then thinking, "wonderful- how can I make that!?" or "that could be better." In this course I hope to not only gain a greater knowledge of what makes a visual work (or not), but also how to talk about it and offer suggestions. I am looking forward to trying out new tools and digging into a dataset during the final project. During the final project, I hope to learn how to take raw data and transform it into a product that can educate and have an emotional appeal. I am nervous, but eager, to put hands on keyboard (and paper) to practice critiquing and creating. 

I also hope to deeply engage with the user research process. I hope for this opportunity to collect new insights and product feedback that I can use to iterate better versions of my visualizations and stories. This will be a new experience collecting feedback on work that I will create and re-create alone, instead of in a group. I hope that this process will help me open up to new perspectives, clarify my message, and connect with a wider audience.
