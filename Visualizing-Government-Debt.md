# Visualizing Government Debt

## Comparing General Government Debt as % of GDP

# Government Debt as % of GDP

This bar chart, created with a web-based tool on the OECD website, displays the level of general government debt as a total percentage of GDP for OECD member countries in 2017.

# Methods and Reflection 

The data included in this set of charts is collected from the OECD. The general government Debt-to-GDP Ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP, a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. The first of two methods is a bar graph which shows the different ratios for countries in 2017. This focuses on a smaller set of data points and helps the user easily compare the ratios by using size of the bar. The tool automatically organized the data from smallest to largest ratio, which made the chart easy to read. Working in the OECD web-based tool was surprisingly intuitive and allowed for easy filtering and grouping of the data. The second of the two visualizations is a grid of line charts. The grid of line charts uses the full OECD dataset, including the date ranges we specified and all country groups and averages. The grid of lines presents clearly a large amount of information side by side, without the risk of "tangling" the lines.   Flourish provides the option to standadize the axis, which lets the user quickly refrence the grid without needed to recalibrate scale each time. However, I found that Flourish would not let me set the dot, but by default used the last date in the dataset. Flourish has a greater range of design elements, compared to the OECD website. However, I found it more difficult to subset data in Flourish. 

Comparing the bar chart and grid of lines chart, both visuals organize the data by country. It is easy to look at these charts and select Canada, for example. Both Flourish and the OECD tool have features that allow additional information to be gathered by hovering over the chart. Both charts also use a small amount of color and the strategic bolding of text to emphasize key information. Contrasting the bar chart and grid of lines chart, the range of time included is a major difference and impacts the number of data points presented in the chart. As such, the grid of lines is presenting much more information to a viewer at once. Another difference is that the grid of lines contains a legend. 

For the additional data visualization, I created two different options. I chose my new data visualizations based on a natural curiosity to want to "zoom in" on the grid chart. As such, I considered how to represent information on each general government's financial situation, considering the change over time. For both new visualizations, I was interested in using the data selection feature to keep the entire dataset available, but allow the user to select their countries of interest based on what stood out to them in the earlier charts. The first is an interactive line graph to provide a deeper dive at the country level.  To be consistent in the interactive line chart I used the same color as in the grid of line charts. I selected this option because it felt like a logical progression and line charts are a clear tool to demonstrate change. Trying to be more creative, the second option I created is an interactive visualization of change over time at the country level using color. I used diverging colors because a ratio less than 100 would show that the gross debt is at a more sustainable level, while having a higher Debt-to-GDP ratio could be a concern for government finance. As such lower ratios are blue (a calmer color), middle are yellow tones (more neutral), and high rates are red (showing concern). Creating this visual, I was unsure that the standalone bar was a helpful representation because the color scale, which shows the range of the data, is not presented in one graphic. Each time you select a coutry, the color bar shifts to only include those rates included in the selection. Consequently, I also created the below Heatmap in Flourish, which uses the same colors and adds context for how one nation compares to other OECD members. While creating the Heatmap, I struggled to create fill values that presented the reporting metrics for each year. As such, the Heatmap does not represent the government debt data as released in the OECD dataset, but can provide a visualization of the range of color values for Debt-to-GDP ratios in one glance. The heatmap also shows where data is missing for particular countrie, similar to the grid of line charts.
