## Comparing General Government Debt as % of GDP

# Government Debt as % of GDP Highlighting the USMCA

This bar chart, created with a web-based tool on the OECD website, displays the level of general government debt as a total percentage of GDP for OECD member countries in 2017. To demonstrate the selection feature, members of the USMCA- Mexico, Canada, and the United States- are highlighted.

# Change in General Government Debt as % of GDP Over Time

 Sparklines can be used to visualize the Debt-to-GDP Ratio easily across a number of participating OECD countries from 1995 to 2020.

# Methods and Reflection 

Markdown to write a paragraph or two about the different methods of visualization, and how they compare / contrast to one another. 

For the additional data visualization, I created two different options. The first is an interactive line graph to provide a deeper dive at the country level. I chose this data visualization based on what my next questions would be following the grid of line charts. I had a natural curiosity to want to "zoom in" on the grid and see information on each general government's financial situation. To be consistent in the interactive line chart I used the same color as in the grid. The second option I created is an interactive visualization of change over time at the country level using color. I used diverging colors because a ratio less than 100 would show that the gross debt is at a more sustainable level, while having a higher Debt-to-GDP ratio could be a concern for government finance. As such lower ratios are blue (a calmer color), middle are yellow tones (more neutral), and high rates are red (showing concern). Creating this visual, I was unsure that the standalone bar was a helpful representation because the color scale, which shows the range of the data, is not presented in one graphic. To  add greater context to the color bar visual, I also created the below Heatmap in Flourish, which uses the same colors and adds context for how one nation compares to other OECD members. 

The data included in this set of charts is collected from the OECD. The general government Debt-to-GDP Ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP, a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance.

This Heatmap demonstrates the Debt-to-GDP Ratio for all participating OECD countries between 2010 and 2020.
